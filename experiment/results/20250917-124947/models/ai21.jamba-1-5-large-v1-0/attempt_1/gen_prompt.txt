   - Remove liability caps for the original party
   - Add liability caps protecting the new party
   - Update insurance requirements and beneficiaries  
   - Modify force majeure and breach consequence clauses
   - Ensure legal validity of the shifted risk allocation

5. **Conditional Logic Preservation**: You must:
   - Maintain if-then-else structures and their dependencies
   - Preserve exception hierarchies and nested conditions
   - Update calculation formulas that depend on changed parties
   - Maintain logical flow and legal coherence

6. **Regulatory Compliance Updates**: You must:
   - Update all regulatory references when jurisdiction changes
   - Modify compliance obligations for new jurisdiction
   - Update currency denominations and legal standards
   - Adjust service of process and dispute resolution mechanisms

Critical Constraints:
- Zero tolerance for broken cross-references or orphaned clauses
- All numbering must cascade correctly through the entire document
- Legal structure and enforceability must be preserved
- No grammatical inconsistencies in entity references
- All defined terms must be properly maintained and updated
