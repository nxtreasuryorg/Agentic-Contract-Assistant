# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Contract Assistant vNext is a new implementation of the contract processing system that leverages an agentic actor-critic pattern for enhanced document manipulation and analysis. This system will replace the current legacy contract assistant with a more sophisticated architecture that can dynamically display RTF content, perform semantic manipulations, and provide real-time feedback through an actor-critic evaluation loop.

The system will be built to handle complex contract operations including counterparty modifications, legal domicile shifts, blame attribution changes, and clause additions/deletions, changes of entity, all while maintaining high accuracy and performance standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a legal professional, I want to upload contract documents with custom prompts and receive intelligent analysis and manipulation through an actor-critic pipeline, so that I can efficiently review and modify contracts with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF contract document with a custom prompt THEN the system SHALL process it through the agentic actor-critic pipeline
2. WHEN the document is large (>25,000 characters) THEN the system SHALL split it into intelligent chunks with overlap for context preservation
3. WHEN the actor component receives the prompt THEN it SHALL edit the contract according to the user's instructions, processing chunks in parallel when applicable
4. WHEN the critic component reviews the actor's edits THEN it SHALL provide feedback and trigger refinement loops as needed
5. WHEN the actor-critic loop completes THEN the system SHALL reassemble chunks and output the final version in RTF format
6. IF the document format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and supported format guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a contract reviewer, I want the system to perform semantic manipulations on contracts using an actor-critic pattern with intelligent chunking, so that I can see different contract variations and their quality assessments even for very long documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the actor component processes a contract THEN it SHALL generate semantic manipulations including counterparty name changes, legal domicile shifts, blame attribution transfers from main party to counterparty, and clause additions/deletions
2. WHEN processing large contracts THEN the system SHALL identify target sections from user instructions and prioritize relevant chunks for processing
3. WHEN the critic component evaluates manipulations THEN it SHALL provide quality scores and feedback for each manipulation type across all processed chunks
4. WHEN quality scores are below threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger up to 5 refinement attempts in the actor-critic loop
5. WHEN quality threshold is met THEN the system SHALL reassemble all chunks and present the successful result to the user
6. WHEN all 5 refinement attempts are exhausted without meeting quality threshold THEN the system SHALL mark the process as failed and ask the user to retry
7. WHEN semantic manipulations are requested THEN the system SHALL evaluate which model performs each manipulation task best

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the frontend to dynamically display RTF content without hardcoded configurations, so that the system can adapt to different contract types and manipulation results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RTF content is generated THEN the frontend SHALL render it dynamically without hardcoded formatting
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply them without requiring code modifications
3. WHEN different contract types are processed THEN the display SHALL adapt automatically to content structure
4. IF RTF rendering fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback display options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain API contracts and configurations externally, so that I can version and manage system behavior without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API contracts are defined THEN they SHALL be stored in external configuration files
2. WHEN configurations are updated THEN they SHALL be versioned and tracked
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configurations dynamically
4. IF configuration loading fails THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and log warnings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time feedback on processing status and quality metrics, so that I can understand the system's progress and confidence in results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing begins THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates
2. WHEN actor-critic iterations occur THEN the system SHALL display current attempt number and quality scores
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL show final quality metrics and processing time
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a legal professional, I want to compare original contracts with manipulated versions side-by-side, so that I can easily identify changes and assess their impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN manipulations are complete THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparison view
2. WHEN viewing comparisons THEN changes SHALL be highlighted with clear visual indicators
3. WHEN multiple manipulation types exist THEN the user SHALL be able to toggle between different views
4. WHEN exporting results THEN both original and manipulated versions SHALL be available in RTF format

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a legal professional, I want the system to handle very long contracts efficiently through intelligent document chunking, so that I can process large legal documents without performance degradation or content loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contract document exceeds 25,000 characters THEN the system SHALL automatically split it into manageable chunks with 5,000 character overlap
2. WHEN chunking occurs THEN the system SHALL identify and prioritize chunks containing target sections mentioned in user instructions
3. WHEN processing chunks THEN the system SHALL maintain document structure and context across chunk boundaries
4. WHEN reassembling processed chunks THEN the system SHALL ensure no content is lost or duplicated
5. WHEN parallel processing is used THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent operations to prevent API rate limiting
6. IF chunking fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to processing the entire document as a single unit

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the new Contract Assistant to integrate seamlessly with existing nxtApp infrastructure, so that users can access it through familiar interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL integrate with existing nxtApp authentication and session management
2. WHEN users access the feature THEN it SHALL follow existing UI/UX patterns and styling
3. WHEN file uploads occur THEN they SHALL use existing document storage mechanisms
4. IF integration points change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
