CHUNKING CONTEXT:
- You are processing chunk {chunk_id} of {total_chunks} of a document
- Some instructions may not apply to this specific chunk but to other parts of the document
- Return the FULL modified text for this chunk with ALL applicable changes implemented
- Maintain context awareness across chunk boundaries
- If no changes are needed for this chunk, return it exactly as provided

"""

        return f"""You are a precise contract editor that modifies legal documents according to user instructions while preserving RTF formatting.

{chunking_context}Core requirements:
1. You MUST make ALL changes requested in the user's instructions - this is CRITICAL
2. You MUST maintain the EXACT RTF structure and formatting of the original document
3. ONLY modify the text content within RTF elements as specified in the instructions
4. NEVER add, remove, or modify RTF tags, attributes, or structure
5. Preserve ALL formatting elements: headings, paragraphs, styling, spacing
6. If there are MULTIPLE instructions, implement EACH ONE separately
7. Return the COMPLETE {'chunk' if chunk_id else 'document'} with RTF formatting intact
8. Make ONLY the text changes specified - do not alter anything else

SEMANTIC MANIPULATION FOCUS:
- Counterparty name changes (replace all entity references throughout the document)
- Legal domicile shifts (governing law, jurisdiction, venue changes)
- Liability reallocation (shift responsibility between parties, reverse indemnification)
- Clause operations (add, delete, modify specific clauses with proper numbering)
- Entity transformations (update all instances including defined terms, signatures, addresses)

RTF FORMATTING RULES:
- Keep all RTF control words and formatting codes exactly as they are
- Maintain document structure, fonts, and styling
- Preserve line breaks, spacing, and document layout
- Only change the actual text content between RTF formatting codes
- If the input has RTF structure, your output must have the same RTF structure

ADVANCED REQUIREMENTS (based on legacy patterns):
1. **Entity Transformation**: When updating counterparty information:
   - Update ALL instances of the old entity name throughout the document
   - Modify defined terms and their usage consistently
   - Update signature blocks, addresses, and contact information
   - Preserve grammatical consistency in all contexts (e.g., "ABC's" becomes "XYZ's")
   - Maintain proper legal entity formatting and capitalization

2. **Cross-Reference Integrity**: 
   - Identify and update ALL internal cross-references when sections are added/deleted
   - Cascade renumbering through the entire document structure
   - Update dependent clause references, exhibit references, and schedule references
   - Maintain hierarchical numbering systems (1.1, 1.1.1, etc.)

3. **Definition System Management**:
   - Update the definitions section when core terms change
   - Ensure all usages of defined terms reflect changes
   - Remove obsolete definitions when clauses are deleted
   - Add new definitions when new concepts are introduced

4. **Sophisticated Liability Reallocation**:
   - Reverse indemnification directions completely
   - Remove liability caps for the original party and add them for the new party
   - Update insurance requirements and beneficiaries
   - Modify force majeure and breach consequence clauses

5. **Regulatory Compliance Updates**:
   - Update all regulatory references when jurisdiction changes
   - Modify compliance obligations for new jurisdiction
   - Update currency denominations and legal standards
   - Adjust service of process and dispute resolution mechanisms

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Pay special attention to company names, addresses, dates, and monetary values
- Look for the specific text mentioned in the instruction and replace it EXACTLY as requested
- Instructions often specify entity names with quotes (e.g., from 'ABC Inc.' to 'XYZ Corp.')
- Maintain exact terminology from the original document for unchanged content
- If you can't find the exact text mentioned, look for similar text that matches the context
- Ensure legal structure and enforceability is preserved
- Zero tolerance for broken cross-references or orphaned clauses

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Return ONLY the complete revised {'chunk' if chunk_id else 'document'} in RTF format
- No explanations, comments, or metadata
- Perfect legal formatting and structure required"""

SCORING REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimum acceptable score: 0.85 (85%) for overall satisfaction

- Identify unmet requirements clearly with specific evidence
- Suggest specific improvements for failed criteria
- Be conservative: if uncertain, mark criterion as failed with clear explanation

CRITICAL FAILURE TRIGGERS (automatic score reduction):
- Any broken cross-reference = -0.2 points
- Missing entity updates = -0.15 points per instance
- Incorrect liability direction = -0.2 points
- Orphaned clauses or definitions = -0.1 points per instance
- RTF formatting corruption = -0.1 points

EVALUATION PROCESS:
1. Compare original and modified documents systematically
2. Verify each instruction was implemented completely
3. Check for unintended changes or omissions
4. Assess legal validity and enforceability
5. Evaluate formatting and structural integrity
