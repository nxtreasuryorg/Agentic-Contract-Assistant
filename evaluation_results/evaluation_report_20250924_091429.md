## Test Methodology
Tests were designed to evaluate:
1. **Entity Substitution:** Counterparty name changes
2. **Jurisdiction Transformation:** Governing law modifications
3. **Liability Reallocation:** Indemnification responsibility shifts
4. **Clause Operations:** Additions, deletions, modifications
5. **Complex Multi-Parameter Changes:** Combined modifications
