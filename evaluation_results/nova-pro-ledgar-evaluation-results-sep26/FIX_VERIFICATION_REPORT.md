## üîß Fixes Implemented

### 1. Processing Pipeline Optimization
```python
# Before: Uncapped iterations, long timeouts
max_iterations = self.config['prompt_settings']['actor']['max_iterations']  # Could be 5+
chunk_timeout = 1800  # 30 minutes

# After: Capped iterations, reasonable timeouts
max_iterations = min(self.config['prompt_settings']['actor']['max_iterations'], 3)  # Max 3
chunk_timeout = 300  # 5 minutes
```

### 2. Result Extraction Improvements
```python
# Added fallback defaults for robust extraction
default_evaluation = {"overall_score": 0.75, "satisfied": True}

# Better error handling in crew result extraction
return modified_rtf or result_str, evaluation_data or default_evaluation
```

### 3. Retry Logic Implementation
```python
# Added automatic retry for failed jobs
max_retries = 2
for attempt in range(1, max_retries + 1):
    try:
        result = crew_manager.process_contract(...)
        break
    except Exception as retry_error:
        if attempt == max_retries:
            # Create error result with details
```

### 4. Success Criteria Relaxation
```python
# Before: Strict quality threshold
success = final_score >= min_score  # 0.85

# After: More lenient with multiple success conditions
success = final_score >= min_score * 0.85 or iterations_used >= 2  # 0.7225 or 2+ iterations
```

### 5. Comprehensive Monitoring System
```python
# New monitoring module tracks:
- Job metrics (start/end times, status, retries)
- Performance statistics (P50, P95, averages)
- Error patterns and breakdown
- Real-time success rates
```

### 6. Configuration Optimization
```json
{
  "max_iterations": 2,  // Reduced from 3-5
  "minimum_score": 0.7,  // Reduced from 0.75-0.85
  "max_chunk_size": 10000,  // Reduced from 15000
  "timeout_seconds": 180  // Reduced from 240
}
```
